# Edge Function Get UUID

### What is it?

A serverless [Edge Function](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/) example that returns a random v4 UUID from Netlify's Edge CDN.

### Play around on the [Demo Site](https://edge-function-get-uuid.netlify.app/)

You can also call the function endpoint directly to return a JSON object

https://edge-function-get-uuid.netlify.app/get

Or deploy your own copy to Netlify

### Bug reports, feature requests, etc

This repo is part of an ongoing project I am working on exploring common use cases for serverless functions, and I welcome contributions and suggestions. Feel free to submit an issue or PR!
